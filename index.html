        <h3>Residents of Nepal’s flood-hit capital returned to their mud-caked homes on Sunday to survey the wreckage of
            devastating floods that have killed at least 148 people across the Himalayan republic.</h3>

        <p>Deadly rain-related floods and landslides are common across South Asia during the monsoon season from June to
            September, but experts say <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1690460">climate change</a> is increasing
            their
            frequency and severity.</p>

        <p>Entire neighbourhoods in Kathmandu were <a
                href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861746/nepal-floods-and-landslides-kill-at-least-66-people-69-missing">
                inundated </a> over the weekend with flash floods reported in rivers coursing through the capital and
            extensive damage to highways connecting the city with the rest of Nepal.</p>

        <p>Kumar Tamang, who lives in a slum area by a riverbank, told <i>AFP </i>that he and his family had to flee
            after
            midnight on Saturday as waters rushed into his shack.</p>

        <p>“This morning we returned and everything looks different,” the 40-year-old said. “We couldn’t even open the
            doors
            to our house, it was jammed with mud,” he added. “Yesterday we were afraid that the water would kill us, but
            today we have no water to clean.”</p>

        <p>Nepal’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority said 148 people had been killed across the
            country with another 59 still missing.</p>

        <p>Home Ministry spokesman Rishi Ram Tiwari told AFP that bulldozers were being used to clear several highways
            that
            had been blocked by debris, cutting Kathmandu off from the rest of the country. “More than 3,000 people have
            been rescued,” he added.</p>

        <p>At least 36 of those killed were aboard three vehicles and were buried alive when earth from a landslide
            careened
            into a highway south of Kathmandu, Nepal Police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told <em> AFP</em>.</p>

        <p>The valley in which the capital sits recorded 240 millimetres (mm) of rain, the country’s weather bureau told
            <a href="https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/09/29/saturday-s-rain-breaks-54-year-old-record-in-kathmandu-valley"
                target="_blank">The Kathmandu Post</a> newspaper. The report said that it was the highest rainfall
            recorded
            in Kathmandu since at least 1970.

        <h2>Chest-deep water</h2>

        <p>The Bagmati River and its numerous tributaries which cut through Kathmandu broke their banks, inundating
            nearby
            homes and vehicles after midnight on Saturday.</p>

        <p>Residents struggled through chest-deep water to get to higher ground. Bishnu Maya Shrestha, who lived in
            another
            inundated area of Kathmandu, said they had to cut the roof of their homes to escape.</p>

        <p>“We jumped from one roof to another to safety and finally they came with boats to rescue us,” Shrestha told
            <i>AFP</i>.
        </p>

        <p>More than 3,000 security personnel were deployed to assist rescue efforts with helicopters and motorboats.
            Rescue
            teams were using rafts to pull survivors to safety.</p>

        <p>Domestic flights resumed in and out of Kathmandu by Sunday morning after weather forced a complete stoppage
            from
            Friday evening, with more than 150 departures cancelled.</p>

        <pre>    The summer monsoon brings South Asia 70-     Related
    80 per cent of its annual rainfall. Monsoon  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1853470/monsoon-havoc" target="_blank">Monsoon havoc</a>
    rains from June to September bring
    widespread <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031">death and destruction</a>
    every year across South Asia, but the number of fatal 
    floods and landslides has increased in recent years.
    </pre>

        <p>Experts say climate change has worsened their frequency and intensity.</p>

        <p>A landslide that hit a road in Chitwan district in July pushed two buses with 59 passengers aboard into a
            river.
            Three people were able to escape alive, but authorities managed to recover only 20 bodies from the accident,
            with raging flood waters impeding the search.</p>

        <p>More than 260 people have died in Nepal in rain-related disasters this year.</p>
